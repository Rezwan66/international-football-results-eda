This report takes a look at some of the past results of international football matches using some Python Data Analysis tools such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. This analysis will also look into the future aspects of some of the performances of the countries with regards to the upcoming Fifa World Cup 2022 to be held in Qatar. We will take a look at factors like some of the best teams of a certain time, along with player and team performances with regards to the venue, etc.
